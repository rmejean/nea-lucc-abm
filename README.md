# Northern Ecuadorian Amazon Land Use & Cover Change Agent-Based Model (NEA LUCC-ABM)
An agent-based model of deforestation dynamics in NEA for my thesis.
This model has an independent initialization generator. This generator allows you to set up initializations and save them as outputs, in order to save computing time during simulations.
